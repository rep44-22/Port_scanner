# Port_scanner
A basic Python script that scans common network ports on a given IP address or hostname and reports which ports are open or closed. Useful for beginners learning about network security and socket programming.

# How to Use
Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).

Run the script in the terminal or command prompt: 
python scanner.py
Enter the target IP address or hostname when prompted.
View the list of open and closed ports.
# Disclaimer
Use this tool only on machines and networks you own or have permission to scan. Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical.
